                        <div class="content">
                            Software Engineering is the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the design, development, operation, and maintenance of software, and the study of these approaches; that is, the application of engineering to software.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The course will be delivered pedagogically to students by combining concepts, latest information, feasible methods and scientific ways. In doing so, students will learn the essence of software engineering, including the related fields of programming language, mathematics, systems analysis, software design and quality management. Related knowledge will be imparted professionally to students through basic theory, practical projects, and industrial training to enhance studentsâ€™ analytical, programming and software design skills. Besides, the course will train students to express themselves clearly and communicative. Concurrently, students are taught to appreciate technology scientifically. By the end of this course, self-study and self-improvement are enhanced as well. We have faith our graduates are innovative and able to compete internationally in current challenging world toward successful careers.
